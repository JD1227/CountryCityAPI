- This application enables users to select a country from the dropdown list and displays its corresponding capital when a button is clicked.

- Making an API call to get data of all the countries with their corresponding capitals.

- On landing, if the user clicks on the button without selecting a country from the dropdown, an alert is shown.

- P.S. Apologies if the information from the API is wrong/incorrect.

- Looking for recommendations for some free, reliable APIs that I can use to get the accurate and correct information for this project. I would really appreciate your input!
